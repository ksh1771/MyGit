2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
CFGBVS-1#1 Warning
Missing CFGBVS and CONFIG_VOLTAGE Design Properties  
Neither the CFGBVS nor CONFIG_VOLTAGE voltage property is set in the current_design.  Configuration bank voltage select (CFGBVS) must be set to VCCO or GND, and CONFIG_VOLTAGE must be set to the correct configuration voltage, in order to determine the I/O voltage support for the pins in bank 0.  It is suggested to specify these either using the 'Edit Device Properties' function in the GUI or directly in the XDC file using the following syntax:

 set_property CFGBVS value1 [current_design]
 #where value1 is either VCCO or GND

 set_property CONFIG_VOLTAGE value2 [current_design]
 #where value2 is the voltage provided to configuration bank 0

Refer to the device configuration user guide for more information.

PLCK-1#1 Warning
Clock Placer Checks  
Sub-optimal placement for a BUFG-BUFG cascade pair. 
Resolution: A dedicated routing path between the two BUFGs can be used if they are placed in cyclically adjacent BUFG sites and both are in the same half (TOP/BOTTOM) side of an SLR.
This is normally an ERROR but the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint is set to FALSE allowing your design to continue. The use of this override is highly discouraged as it may lead to very poor timing results. It is recommended that this error condition be corrected in the design.

	bufgmux_0 (BUFGCTRL.O) is provisionally placed by clockplacer on BUFGCTRL_X0Y30
	bufgmux_2 (BUFGCTRL.I0) is provisionally placed by clockplacer on BUFGCTRL_X0Y26

Related violations: <none>

XDCM-1#1 Warning
Delay constraint missing on IO port

The port 'dummy_out' does not have any I/O delay defined. It is necessary to have I/O (input or output) delays defined on all the ports to properly time the FPGA interface.
Related violations: <none>

XDCM-1#3 Warning
Delay constraint missing on IO port

Related violations: <none>

XDCM-1#4 Warning
Delay constraint missing on IO port  
The port 'sys_rst' does not have any I/O delay defined. It is necessary to have I/O (input or output) delays defined on all the ports to properly time the FPGA interface.
Related violations: <none>

XDCM-1#5 Warning
Delay constraint missing on IO port  
The port 'tdc_en_out' does not have any I/O delay defined. It is necessary to have I/O (input or output) delays defined on all the ports to properly time the FPGA interface.

XDCM-1#6 Warning
Delay constraint missing on IO port  
The port 'tp_out[0], tp_out[1], tp_out[2], tp_out[3], tp_out[4], tp_out[5], tp_out[6], tp_out[7], tp_out[8], tp_out[9], tp_out[10], tp_out[11], tp_out[12], tp_out[13], tp_out[14] (the first 15 of 75 listed)' does not have any I/O delay defined.
